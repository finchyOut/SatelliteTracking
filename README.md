This is a way to track my thesis progress work. Currently the most up to date files are orbit10 and orbit11. 
SatPCMCV2 is the most up to date nimble code.
These will simulate fake geostationary satellite data that has noise introduced to the velocity to help 
account for natural drift that occurs in the space. When the satellite reaches a max distance the satellite
will initiate station keeping to return it to the correct location over earth fixed at some longitude. Once
back on the correct orbit. The satellite will drop stationkeeping behavior.
