### Satellite code
This is a way to track my thesis progress work. These are the files you should use to generate different satellite orbits, plot the orbits, and measure the difference between the generated data using MMD. The files are bangbangSat.py, lqrSat.py, pdSat.py, MMD.py, satelliteCallFunc.py, satellitePlots.py, sunAndMoonOrbits.py, and mainRun.py. Note you also need to download the de421.bsp to be able to use the SkyfieldBody.

### R stan code 
The most up to date stan files are the pdControllerV2.rmd and the pdControllerV3.stan.
